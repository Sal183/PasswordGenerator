<h1> Password Generator Starter Code </h1>
Third Week Challenge was a way tougher than CSS and HTML but after sitting down and taking a step away to think clearly I was able to simplify my once complex code to something cleaner and much easier to wrap my head around.

When Generate button is pressed it prompts you to choose a number between 8 and 128 
After initiating a correct input you will be prompted if you would like to...
1. Include Lowercase Letters
2. Include Uppercase Letters
3. Include Special Characters
4. Include Numbers
